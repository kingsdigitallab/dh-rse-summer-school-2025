## Software Development Life Cycle

Understanding the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is an essential skill for managing digital humanities (DH) projects effectively, or indeed, any digital project. The SDLC provides a structured framework that guides the development process from initial conception through development to deployment and maintenance. By adopting a systematic approach, researchers and research software engineers can ensure that project objectives are clearly defined, resources are efficiently allocated, and potential risks are identified and mitigated early on. This methodology enhances the quality and sustainability of digital outputs and fosters better collaboration among interdisciplinary teams. Incorporating SDLC practices into DH projects leads to more robust, maintainable, and impactful research outcomes.
