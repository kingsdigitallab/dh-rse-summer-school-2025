        "# Greening your Code Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some practices for writing more energy-efficient code, often referred to as \"greening your code\":\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Optimize Data Structures:**\n",
        "    *   When importing your dataset encode the column to the most effective type. E.g. an integer will always be faster than a float so if your numeric column is an integer you shall encode it as integer and not as a float\n",
        "    *   Select data structures appropriate for the task to minimize memory usage and access time.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Reduce Redundancy:**\n",
        "    *   Avoid unnecessary computations. Cache results when possible.\n",
        "    *   Eliminate duplicate code, which can lead to redundant processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Minimize I/O Operations:**\n",
        "    *   Reading and writing data to disk or across a network consumes significant energy.\n",
        "    *   Buffer data when possible to perform fewer, larger I/O operations instead of many small ones.\n",
        "    *   Only read the data you actually need.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Use Efficient Libraries and Frameworks:**\n",
        "    *   Leverage well-optimised libraries and frameworks that are designed for performance and efficiency.\n",
        "    *   For computationally intensive tasks, consider libraries that utilise underlying hardware efficiently (e.g., NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch).\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Manage Memory Effectively:**\n",
        "    *   Release memory when it's no longer needed to reduce the memory footprint and the overhead of garbage collection.\n",
        "    *   If you are done with the analysis of an object just remove it\n",
        "    *   Avoid creating large, unnecessary objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Parallelise and Distribute When Appropriate:**\n",
        "    *   For suitable tasks, parallelising or distributing computations across multiple cores or machines can potentially reduce the overall execution time and, in some cases, energy consumption (though this can be complex and depends on the task and infrastructure).\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  **Profile and Measure:**\n",
        "    *   Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in your code where most of the execution time and resource consumption occur. Focus your optimization efforts on these areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Prototyping:**\n",
        "    *   When working with large dataset, don't build up your code on the totality of the dataset but create a very small subset on which to test your code and then progressivly test it across larger and larger sections.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Be Mindful of Loops:**\n",
        "    *   Optimise loops to reduce the number of iterations and the work performed within each iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Code Review:**\n",
        "    *   Review code with efficiency in mind, identifying potential areas for optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   \n",
        "\\\\\n",
        "These are just some examples and not always is possible to implement them becasue a lot will depend on the hardware you are working on and the tasks you are trying to perform. The general suggestion is to write your first working draft and then refine it to be more efficient/consume less Co2.\n",
        "\n",
        "\\\\\n",
        "\n",
        "In the code below we are going to see three quick examples on how text analysis related code can be optimised.\n",
        "\n",
        "All code is using the EmissionTracker from the Codecarbon package to check how changing the code impact the carbon emissions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\\\\\n",
        "\n",
        "One caveat is that these data will always be an estimate and will be more accurate if you are going to run things locally.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the examples there are three challenges for you to pick from to test yourself.\n"
