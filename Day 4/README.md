# Day 4: 3 July 2025 - Centre for Data, Culture & Society

## Responsible Digital Research

Responsible digital research adopts ethical and sustainable methodologies to minimise environmental impact whilst maintaining data integrity and promoting long-term sustainability. Following a preliminary overview on the application of humanities perspectives to computational and digital research, this session will delve into ‘good enough’ practices in data acquisition, the utilisation of High-Performance Computing (HPC), and overarching strategies throughout the research project lifecycle. We will consider the ethical and legal ramifications of web scraping social media content, alongside exploring optimisation techniques for HPC, thereby fostering a dialogue around the humanities’ role in advancing more sustainable digital research practices.
