# Day 4: 3 July 2025 - Centre for Data, Culture & Society

## Responsible Digital Research

Responsible digital research adopts ethical and sustainable methodologies to minimise environmental impact whilst maintaining data integrity and promoting long-term sustainability. Following a preliminary overview on the application of humanities perspectives to computational and digital research, this session will delve into ‘good enough’ practices in data acquisition, the utilisation of High-Performance Computing (HPC), and overarching strategies throughout the research project lifecycle. We will consider the ethical and legal ramifications of web scraping social media content, alongside exploring optimisation techniques for HPC, thereby fostering a dialogue around the humanities’ role in advancing more sustainable digital research practices.

## Abstracts
### Introduction *(Lisa Otty)*
To kick off the day, we are going to hear about the work currently done by the Centre for Data Culture and Society and the DHCC. We are going to explore the importance of maintaining a humanities approach to Digital Research, and how this approach encourages us to think about the social, ethical and environmental impact of our work.
  
### Responsible Data Collection  *(Lucia Michielin & Jessica Witte)*
During the first talk of the day, we will discuss good (enough) practices in working with research data. Throughout the process of finding, collecting, and organising data, we can encounter a range of practical and ethical challenges in ensuring that we consider FAIR principles and GDPR compliance. We will explore some of these common pitfalls and how to negotiate them throughout the data pipeline.
 
### Estimating carbon emissions from high-performance computing *(Andy Turner)*
In this presentation, we will see how EPCC has enabled users to estimate carbon emissions from the use of the UK National Supercomputing Service, ARCHER2. We will also cover what strategies are available to reduce carbon emissions from the use of high-performance computing (spoiler alert: you need to do less computing!).

### Minimal Computing for Digital Research and Publishing *(Christopher Ohge)*
Using a case study of the presenter’s project, the [Herman Melville Electronic Library](https://melville.electroniclibrary.org/), this seminar will show how the project was initially conceived and how it was redesigned using minimal computing principles. It suggests that ‘good enough’ digital editions need to be the product of an iterative process. It concludes with a brief presentation of the [Digital Humanities Climate Coalition Toolkit](https://sas-dhrh.github.io/dhcc-toolkit/), which informed much of this work and provides ideas for new directions.
